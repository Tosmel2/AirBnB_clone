#AirBnB_clone project

The Airbnb clone project is based on  creating a copy of the Airbnb. Only some features will be implemented and will be listed below once completed.

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.

    Command Interpreter
The Command Interpreter is used to manage the whole application's functionality from the command line, such as:

Crete a new object.
Retrieve an object from a file, database, etc.
Execute operation on objects. e.g. Count, compute statistics, etc.
Update object's attributes.
Destroy an object.
